Poll View and MX Live Perspective
=================================

Introduction
------------
The Poll view and associated items have been created to allow the user to
monitor files which are changing and to display the contents.

Concept
-------
Each Polling Job is described by a simple text file which can be opened using
DAWN.  These files are persistent and will be available every time DAWN
starts.

Interaction
-----------
All the interactions with the polling should be done through the poll view.  All of the functions available 
are replicated as easy to use buttons on the top of the view, or with more information buttons in the drop
down menu.  These functions are:

 - **Pause All Jobs** Pauses all the jobs so they are no longer updated
 - **Restart All Jobs** restarts all the jobs so they will poll again
 - **Delete Job** Deletes the selected job from the list, and removes the associated file.
 - **Delete All Jobs** Clears out all the jobs in the list.
 - **Refresh All Jobs** Reparses all the job information, this can be useful when changing the polling time to force an update

The final thing which is useful to know is where the polling job files are sent, and this is specified in the preferences.
In the top menu click Window->Preferences and then select Polling Preferences.  In this you can see which directory you wish to use
and how to change them.
